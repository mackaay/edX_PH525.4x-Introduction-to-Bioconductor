#We can answer such question using Bioconductor tools. The human genome sequence is provided in the BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19 package. If you have not done so already please donwload and install this package. Note that it encodes 3 billion bases and is therefore a large package (over 800MB) so make time to download it especially if you have a slow internet connection.
library(BiocInstaller)
biocLite("BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19")
#Then load the package and note that you now have access to sequence information
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19
#Note this divided into chromosomes and includes severla unmapped. We will learn to use this type of object.
#We can access chromosome 11 like this:
chr11seq <- BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19[["chr11"]]
#Here, for example, is a segment of 25 bases starting  at base 1 million 
subseq(chr11seq,start=10^6,width=25)

#Note that in the previous assessments we focused on static database information: genome sequence and SNPs. In previous courses we have seen the 'tissuesGeneExpression' data which is experimental data measured with microarrays. If you have not installed it you can do it like this:
library(devtools)
install_github("genomicsclass/tissuesGeneExpression")
#You can load the data:
library(tissuesGeneExpression)
data(tissuesGeneExpression)
head(e[,1:5])
table(tissue)
#The rows of the matrix e are the features, in this case representing genes, and the columns are the samples. The entries of the matrix are gene expression measurements (in log scale) obtained using a microarray technology. 

#We can stratify the data and make boxplots like this:
boxplot(e["209169_at",]~tissue,las=2)
